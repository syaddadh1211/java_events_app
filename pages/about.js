      <p>
        This project aims to build a centralized forum or website that provides
        online event schedules held by companies/campuses/government in the East
        Java region so that online events are more organized and easy to track.
        It is enough to enter this site and search for the event you want then
        register your email at the event, then you will always be notified
        approaching the D day of the event. I hope this project can be developed
        even further not only for the East Java region but also throughout
        Indonesia
